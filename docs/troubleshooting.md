# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter when using the Phone Agent system.

## API Issues

### Authentication Failures

**Issue**: API requests fail with a 401 Unauthorized error.

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid API token
- Expired API token
- Missing Authorization header
- Incorrect Authorization header format

**Solutions**:
1. Verify that your API token is correct and not expired
2. Ensure the Authorization header is properly formatted: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`
3. Check if your token has the necessary permissions
4. Generate a new API token if needed

### Rate Limiting

**Issue**: API requests fail with a 429 Too Many Requests error.

**Possible Causes**:
- Exceeding the API rate limits
- Too many concurrent requests

**Solutions**:
1. Implement exponential backoff for retries
2. Reduce the frequency of API calls
3. Batch requests where possible
4. Cache responses to reduce API calls

### Invalid Request Format

**Issue**: API requests fail with a 400 Bad Request error.

**Possible Causes**:
- Missing required fields
- Invalid field values
- Incorrect JSON format

**Solutions**:
1. Check the API documentation for required fields
2. Validate field values before sending
3. Ensure your JSON is properly formatted
4. Use a JSON validator to check your request body

## Call Scheduling Issues

### Scheduling Failures

**Issue**: Unable to schedule calls.

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid phone number format
- Scheduled time in the past
- Missing required fields
- Bland.ai API issues

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure phone numbers are in E.164 format (+15551234567)
2. Verify that the scheduled time is in the future
3. Check that all required fields are provided
4. Verify your Bland.ai API key and agent ID
5. Check the Bland.ai status page for service issues

### Scheduling Conflicts

**Issue**: Call scheduling fails with a scheduling conflict error.

**Possible Causes**:
- Agent already scheduled for that time
- Recipient already has a call at that time
- System maintenance window

**Solutions**:
1. Try scheduling at a different time
2. Check existing schedules for conflicts
3. Use a different agent if available
4. Implement a retry with alternative times

### Call Connection Failures

**Issue**: Scheduled calls fail to connect.

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid phone number
- Recipient not answering
- Network issues

5. Always include a plain text alternative

## Webhook Issues

### Webhook Verification Failures

**Issue**: Webhook requests are rejected with signature verification failures.

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect webhook signing secret
- Modified request body
- Expired timestamp
- Missing headers

**Solutions**:
1. Verify that the correct webhook signing secret is configured
2. Ensure the request body is not modified before verification
3. Check if the webhook was created after the signing secret was last rotated
4. Verify that all required headers are present

### Webhook Delivery Failures

**Issue**: Webhooks are not being delivered to your target endpoint.

**Possible Causes**:
- Endpoint unavailable
- Network issues
- Timeout issues
- Authentication failures

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your endpoint is accessible
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure your endpoint responds within the timeout period
4. Verify authentication credentials
5. Check server logs for specific errors

### Webhook Processing Errors

**Issue**: Webhooks are delivered but not processed correctly.

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid payload format
- Missing required fields
- Business logic errors
- Database issues

**Solutions**:
1. Validate the webhook payload structure
2. Check for missing or invalid fields
3. Review your processing logic for errors
4. Verify database connectivity
5. Enable debug logging for more information

## Calendar Issues

### Calendar Event Generation Failures

**Issue**: Unable to generate calendar events.

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid date/time format
- Missing required fields
- ICAL.js library issues

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure dates and times are in valid formats
2. Check that all required fields are provided
3. Verify the ICAL.js library is properly installed
4. Test with simple calendar events first

### Calendar Event Parsing Failures

**Issue**: Unable to parse calendar content.

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid iCalendar format

## Debugging Techniques

### Enabling Debug Mode

To get more detailed logs:

1. Set the `DEBUG_WEBHOOKS` environment variable to `true`
2. Restart the application
3. Check the logs for detailed debugging information

### Monitoring Logs

To monitor application logs:

```bash
npm run logs
```

To filter logs for specific information:

```bash
npm run logs -- --filter "webhook"
```

### Testing API Endpoints

Use curl or Postman to test API endpoints directly:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-app-name.pages.dev/api \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

### Webhook Testing

Use a tool like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to test webhook delivery:

1. Create a temporary webhook endpoint
2. Configure your webhook to point to this endpoint
3. Trigger the webhook event
4. Inspect the received payload
