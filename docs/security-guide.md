# Security Guide

This guide outlines the security features, best practices, and considerations for the Phone Agent system.

## Security Overview

The Phone Agent system is designed with security as a primary consideration, implementing multiple layers of protection for data, communications, and access control.

### Security Principles

The security architecture is built on these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security controls at different layers
2. **Least Privilege**: Components operate with minimal required permissions
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default
4. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is protected at rest and in transit
5. **Continuous Validation**: Inputs and outputs are continuously validated

## Authentication and Authorization

### API Authentication

The Phone Agent API uses token-based authentication:

- **Bearer Tokens**: API requests require a bearer token in the Authorization header
- **Token Management**: Tokens can be created, revoked, and rotated
- **Token Scopes**: Tokens can be limited to specific operations
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens can be configured to expire after a set period

Example of a properly authenticated request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-app-name.pages.dev/api/calls \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

### Webhook Authentication

Webhooks are authenticated using cryptographic signatures:

- **HMAC Signatures**: Webhooks include a signature generated using HMAC-SHA256
- **Timestamp Validation**: Signatures include a timestamp to prevent replay attacks
- **Signature Verification**: The Phone Agent verifies signatures before processing webhooks

## Data Security

### Data in Transit

All data transmitted to and from the Phone Agent is secured:

- **HTTPS Only**: All communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Strong Ciphers**: Only strong cipher suites are supported
- **Certificate Validation**: Certificates are validated for all external connections
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforced to prevent downgrade attacks

### Data at Rest

Sensitive data stored by the Phone Agent is protected:

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- **Encrypted Storage**: Data stored in Cloudflare KV is encrypted at rest
- **Minimal Data Retention**: Only necessary data is stored
- **Data Expiration**: Temporary data is automatically expired after use

### Sensitive Data Handling

The Phone Agent implements special handling for sensitive data:

- **Phone Numbers**: Partially masked in logs and responses
- **Email Addresses**: Protected from unauthorized access
- **API Keys**: Never exposed in responses or logs
- **Webhook Secrets**: Stored securely and never exposed

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Request Validation

All incoming requests are validated:

- **Schema Validation**: Requests are validated against defined schemas
- **Type Checking**: Data types are strictly checked
- **Range Validation**: Numeric values are checked against allowed ranges
- **Format Validation**: Strings are validated for correct format (email, phone, etc.)

### Output Sanitization

All outgoing data is sanitized:

- **HTML Escaping**: HTML content is properly escaped
- **JSON Encoding**: JSON output is properly encoded
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents injection attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing

## Webhook Security

### Signature Verification

Webhook signatures are verified using a secure process:

1. Extract the signature from the `Resend-Signature` header
2. Extract the timestamp from the `Resend-Timestamp` header
3. Concatenate the timestamp and request body
4. Generate an HMAC-SHA256 signature using the webhook secret
5. Compare the generated signature with the provided signature
6. Reject the webhook if signatures don't match or the timestamp is too old

Example signature verification code:

```typescript
function verifyWebhookSignature(
  payload: string,
  signature: string,
  timestamp: string,
  secret: string
): boolean {
  // Create the signed payload
  const signedPayload = `${timestamp}.${payload}`;
  
  // Create the expected signature
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(signedPayload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  // Compare signatures using a timing-safe comparison
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}
```

### Replay Protection

To prevent replay attacks, webhooks include timestamp validation:

- Webhooks older than 5 minutes are rejected
- The current time is compared with the webhook timestamp
- Timestamps are required to be in seconds since the Unix epoch

## Error Handling and Logging

### Secure Error Handling

Errors are handled securely to prevent information leakage:

- **Generic Error Messages**: Public error messages don't reveal implementation details
- **Detailed Internal Logging**: Detailed errors are logged for debugging
- **No Stack Traces in Responses**: Stack traces are never included in responses
- **Error Categorization**: Errors are categorized for appropriate handling

### Security Logging

Security events are logged for monitoring and auditing:

- **Authentication Attempts**: Successful and failed authentication attempts
- **API Access**: Access to sensitive API endpoints
- **Configuration Changes**: Changes to security-related configuration
- **Webhook Processing**: Webhook verification successes and failures

## Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting prevents abuse and ensures fair usage:

- **IP-Based Limiting**: Limits requests by IP address
- **Token-Based Limiting**: Limits requests by API token
- **Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Different limits for different endpoints
- **Graduated Response**: Increasing delays for repeated excessive usage

### Abuse Detection

The system includes measures to detect and prevent abuse:

- **Unusual Activity Detection**: Monitoring for unusual patterns
- **Brute Force Protection**: Protection against authentication brute force
- **Request Throttling**: Automatic throttling of suspicious activity
- **IP Blocking**: Temporary blocking of abusive IP addresses

## Dependency Security

### Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed securely:

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary dependencies are included
- **Pinned Versions**: Dependency versions are pinned for consistency

### Third-Party Services

Integration with third-party services follows security best practices:

- **Minimal Permissions**: Services are granted only required permissions
- **Secure API Keys**: API keys are stored securely
- **Regular Rotation**: Credentials are regularly rotated
- **Service Validation**: Services are validated for security compliance

## Deployment Security

### Secure Deployment Process

The deployment process includes security measures:

- **CI/CD Security**: Security checks in the CI/CD pipeline
- **Environment Isolation**: Development, staging, and production environments are isolated
- **Deployment Verification**: Deployments are verified before becoming active
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback in case of security issues

### Environment Configuration

Environment configuration follows security best practices:

- **Separate Configurations**: Different configurations for different environments
